# Ezpelette Pepper Production Analysis (2024) [EN]

## Project Description

This project is a **learning exercise** developed for the subject **Industrial Informatics** at the **University of the Basque Country (EHU)**.

The project was **independently conceived and developed** as a personal initiative
with the objective of practicing **Python programming** and learning the **basic use of data analysis and visualization libraries**, specifically **pandas** and **matplotlib**.

Using a real open dataset, the program analyzes the **2024 production of Piment d’Espelette (AOP)**. The data is loaded from a CSV file, explored, grouped by municipality, and finally visualized using a bar chart.  
Municipality names are manually translated from French to Basque (Euskera), following the author's criterion that the Basque denominations should be regarded as the official place names.

This project is intended for **educational purposes**
